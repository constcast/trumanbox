The configuration files in this directory, are just meant to provide
a very basic example on how to configure a local running nameserver, 
resolving all names to its own IP address. Please change the IP 
address in the last line of db.root accordingly. We propose to set it
to an arbitrary IP, which is from client side behind the TrumanBox.
