The TrumanBox is configured via ini files. The ini-files contain several
sections which configure the TrumanBox modules. This file documents the
available options

Section: [main]
===============

mode = 2 # 1 == full emulation, 2 == half proxy, 3 == full proxy

	Possible values:
			1, (full emulation)
			2, (half proxy)
			3, (full proxy)

	The "mode" options configures how the TrumanBox handels intercepted
	connections from the malware to the Internet. The TrumanBox has three
	possiblities to cope with a connection:
	
	1.) It can drop the connection
	2.) It can forward the connection to the Internet
	3.) It may redirect the connection to a local service

	The mode defines the behavior: 
		full emulation mode will try to redirect the connection to a
		local service or drop the connection if that is not possible

		half proxy, will try to forward the connection to the internet
		and redirect to a local service in case the internet servcie
		is not reachable

		full proxy will only try to pass the connection to the
		internet


protocol_identifier = 0 # 0 == buildin, 1 == opendpi

	Defines how the trumanbox will try to identify application layer
	protocols. The buildin mode is the only mode currenlty supported.
	
global_redirect="127.0.0.1"

	Default redirect address that will be used by the TrumanBox for
	redirecting connections. This value may be overriden for special
	services

work_dir="/var/local/truman-box"

	Directory that will be used as working directory for the trumanbox. It
	must exists before the trumanbox starts. The program will then try to
	change into this directory. All relative paths are relative to
	work_dir.

remotepw="strenggeheim"

	To be documented. 

logger_restart_string="restart"

	to be documented

logger_start_string="start"

	to be documented 

logger_stop_string="stop"

	to be documented

Section: [dns]
==============

The TrumanBox ships a small buildin DNS resolver, that can resolve malware DNS
requests and influence to which address the malware connects.

port = 53

	The port at which the DNS server will listen

listen_address = "192.168.27.254"

	The IP address on which the DNS server will listen.

fake_address = "192.168.28.1"

	The address that should be returned if a domain name is no longer
	resolvable by the standard resolving process.

return_original = 1 
	Possible values:
		0 == always return fake, 
		1 == return original if resolving is possible

	By default, the buildin DNS server aims at resolving the domain name,
	which is requested by the Malware. This resolving may sucecced or
	fail. This option defines what happens in the case that the requested
	domain can be resolved.
