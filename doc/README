The usual setup for running the trumanbox consists of at least two PCs:

PC1 (running the malware) -> PC2 (running trumanbox) -> Internet

PC2 needs two interfaces: One interface (e.g. eth0) connects to PC1, the other
interface (e.g. eth1) connects to the Internet. Hence, PC2 is acting as the
default router for PC2.

It is possible to run a virtual machine on PC2, which executes the malware.
However, we tried to run such setups and ran into many problems with the
virtual network interfaces of some of the popular virtualization products.

I recommend a setup which looks like this

PC1 (runs a virtualized or native Windows/Linux/whatever platform your malware
runs on, in our example it runs VMWare):

Host interface of eth0: some private IP address, e.g. 192.168.0.1
Vmware Setup: Bridging with eth0, virtual machine IP in the same subnet, e.g. 192.168.0.2
DNS-Servers for the virtual machine: IP of PC2 (trumanbox ships a DNS server)
Default Gateway for the virutal machine: IP of PC2

PC2 (runs the TrumanBox):

eth0 (connected to PC1), IP, e.g. 192.168.0.254
eth1 (connected to the Internet),  public IP from your ISP

The trumanbox will intercept any connection that is done from the malware to
the Internet (if you did setup it correctly, see INSTALL for more information). 

When the TrumanBox (on PC2) intercepts a connection from the malware (PC1), it
has two possibilities to cope with the connection. It may pass the connection
to the Internet (in case the destination host is still reachable), or it can
redirect the connection to a local service, e.g. a locally installed ProFTP
server. The decision depends on your trumanbox configuration and/or on whether
the target service is reachable (see CONFIGURATION for more information).
