How to install the Trumanbox:

The TrumanBox is currenlty under heavy development and does not support system
wide installation right now. We currently run it from the source directories
right now. 

Assuming your system fulfils all requirements (see below) you just have to follow these steps:
 
1.) run autoreconf -i

2.) run configure 

3.) run 'make'

4.) edit your config file (see src/configs for example configuration files)

5.) Adopt the configuration parameters (MALWARE_IF, INTERNET_IF, MALWARE_IF_IP) to 
    your system settings. Run etc/trumanbox/tb_setup.sh

5.) run 'trumanbox -f <configfile.ini>' (as root)

Requirements:
- iptables (we use v1.4.6)
- standard development libraries
- arbitrary HTTP, FTP, IRC, SMTP server services listening locally on their standart ports (we use Lighttpd, ProFTPD, UnrealIRC and Exim)
- autotools 
- opendpi (optional)
- libsqlite-dev
- postgres development files
