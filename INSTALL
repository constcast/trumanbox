How to install the Trumanbox:

The TrumanBox is currenlty under heavy development and does not support system
wide installation right now. We currently run it from the source directories
right now. 

Assuming your system fulfils all requirements (see below) you just have to
follow these steps:
 
1.) run autoreconf -i

2.) run configure 

3.) run 'make'

4.) If you use the postgresql logger, you need to set up the postgres database
    first. Make sure it is installed correctly and running. You need to create
    a db user and a database for your trumanbox first. After you did this,
    make sure you can run 
    
    etc/trumanbox/setupdb.sh <db-user> <dbname>

    where <db-user> and <dbname> are the username and the database you just
    created. The script uses the "psql" tool for connecting to your database,
    and will prompt you for <db-user>s password (so make sure you can connect
    to this db using psql -U <db-user> -W <dbname>). 


5.) Before running the trumanbox for the first time (and after each system
    restart), you need to run the script /etc/trumanbox/tb_setup.sh. This will
    set up the correct netfilter tables. Before runnig it, you have to adopt
    the configuration parameters (MALWARE_IF, INTERNET_IF, MALWARE_IF_IP) to
    your system settings.

6.) edit your config file (see src/configs for example configuration files)

7.) run 'trumanbox -f <configfile.ini>' (as root)

Requirements:
- iptables (we use v1.4.6)
- standard development libraries
- arbitrary HTTP, FTP, IRC, SMTP server services listening locally on their standart ports (we use Lighttpd, ProFTPD, UnrealIRC and Exim)
- autotools 
- opendpi (optional)
- libsqlite3-dev
- libopenssl-dev
- postgres development files (most systems: libpqxx)
