How to install the Trumanbox:

Assuming your system fulfils all requirements (see below) you just have to follow these steps:
 
#1.) change the configurations files according your system
#	configuration files are:
#		* src/definitions.h
#		* etc/trumanbox/bridge_config.sh

1.) run autoreconf -i

2.) run configure 

2.) run 'make'

#3.) run 'make install' (as root) (not supported right now)

#4.) run '/etc/trumanbox/setting_up_the_bridge.sh" (as root) (not supported right now)

5.) run 'trumanbox' (as root)

#6.) run 'make uninstall' (only if you don't like the trumanbox)


#add 2.):
#'make' will compile the program and build the executable called 'trumanbox'

#add 3.):
#'make install' will copy 
#- the executable file named trumanbox to /usr/sbin
#- all files in etc/trumanbox to /etc/trumanbox (which will be created before by mkdir)

#add 6.):
#'make uninstall' will remove 
#- the executable /usr/sbin/trumanbox
#- all files in /etc/trumanbox and delete including the folder /etc/trumanbox itself
